# **Python â€“ The Ignition**

- Creating Variables- Python has no command for declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
  - x = 5
print(x)
  - x = 4       # x is of type int
x = &quot;Sally&quot; # x is now of type str
print(x)
- Casting- If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
  - x = str(3)    # x will be &#39;3&#39;
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0

- Get the Type- You can get the data type of a variable with the type()function.
  - x = 5
y = &quot;John&quot;
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
    - output:

\&lt;class &#39;int&#39;\&gt;
\&lt;class &#39;str&#39;\&gt;

- x = &quot;John&quot; == x = &#39;John&#39; #String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes.
- A != a #case sensitive
- Value Assignment
  - x, y, z = &quot;Orange&quot;, &quot;Banana&quot;, &quot;Cherry&quot;
  - x = y = z = &quot;Orange&quot;
  - fruits = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;cherry&quot;]
x, y, z = fruits

- \&lt;global\&gt; variable
  - If you use the global keyword, the variable belongs to the global scope
  - x = &quot;awesome&quot;
def myfunc():
  global x
  x = &quot;fantastic&quot;
myfunc()
print(&quot;Python is &quot; + x)
